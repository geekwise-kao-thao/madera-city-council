## Notes on increase productivity ideas

1. Create header and footer css on separate files or maybe just one file will make it easier to navigate.  This is best used when it comes to media queries because if each html file had its own media queries with header and footer in it, it will be harder to code and clean up coding when polishing.  By keeping header and footer media queries separate, any media query at the same max width for that particular file will not include any css from other files.  Therefore easier for others to find or update code.
